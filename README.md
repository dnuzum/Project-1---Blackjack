# Project-1---Blackjack
#### Derek Nuzum - WDI SEA 06 Project 1

__Overview:__

This is a full functional user versus computer blackjack game that calculates score and winner of each round along with a self-shuffling deck and auto-betting system all encapsulated within a Seattle theme.

__Future Additions:__

* Multiple users/computer players
* User input and stored name value
* User controlled bets
* Animations for shuffling and dealing cards
* Cleaner code

__User Stories:__

1. I am a gambler so I want to play cards without going into bankruptcy.
2. I am going to gamble and want to practice how to play.
3. I like to play blackjack, but have nowhere/no way to play.

__Difficulties:__

I need to work on DRY code. I attempted to use a card API, but couldn't get it to work in a way that I understood so I ended up writing a lot out so that I could make the game function.
